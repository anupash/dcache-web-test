<h1> Past events </h1>

<p> This page contains past events from the NeIC <a href="https://wiki.neic.no/wiki/Event_calendar">event calendar</a>, which includes both NeIC events and stakeholder events where NeIC either has a presence or simply wants to advertize. You may also want to look for <a href="/events">current events</a>.

<h3> Highlights </h3>

var widget = document.scripts[document.scripts.length - 1].parentNode;
